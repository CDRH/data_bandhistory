      <p class="tei_p">The record of the University band is a long and creditable one. It has rendered important service to the Military Department and to University activities in general. Its services have been eagerly sought and highly appreciated on such occasions as patriotic gatherings and other civic events. It is well known to the public through its participation in patriotic drives, Ak-Sar-Ben festivities and the like. During the past few years it has been under especially competent leadership and is said by competent critics to produce music of a high order.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">The band is now planning to give concerts in a number of cities of the state. Knowing its record, I confidently anticipate that those who attend these concerts will be pleased with what they hear, and will recognize, as our local people do, in the band a highly creditable University and state organization.</p>
