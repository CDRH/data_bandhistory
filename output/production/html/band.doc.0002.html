          <h3>PART I. THE MILITARY BAND</h3>
          <div class="section">
            <h4>I.  INTRODUCTION</h4>

            <p class="tei_p">1. This outline is intended to supplement and to aid in reviewing the basic drill course, and serve as a text for the University of Nebraska R.O.T.C. bands. If the basic course has not been studied, it is even more necessary that this manual be mastered. It consists of an adaptation of infantry drill regulations for use by R.O.T.C. bands and an explanation of the formations of a football band.</p>

            <p class="tei_p">
              2. Nearly every band attempts both to march and to play. Some bands can play well, others can march well; but few bands can do both. Too great a percentage of rehearsal time spent on either function seriously impairs the other function. It is therefore important that the drills be planned carefully and that the bandmembers be conversant with the material in this manual so that the purpose of the drill may be accomplished quickly and precisely. Read this manual and re-read it -- even memorize the contents and be able to apply what you learn in drills.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">3. Always bear in mind that a greater number of people who hear a band hear it only when it is marching. Indeed, judging from the attendance at concerts compared with the number of football spectators and parade-watchers, the percentage of people who know the band only as a marching group can be estimated at about 90 to 95 per cent. It is evident that a band which would serve to entertain the majority of its audience must perfect all phases of its performance. Marching and playing are equally important to a college band.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">4. The purpose of instruction of individuals is to secure smart, precise, uniform movements when the individuals are in formation. The band whose members are well drilled in the basic movements will have little difficulty, and will consume little time, in mastering the more complex movements of band drill. The tendency is to rush into more advanced drill far too soon. With insufficient elementary instruction, success in drill of the whole band is utterly impossible. Intelligent thorough training in the simple individual movements is an indispensable requirement and should precede any effort at drill of the band as a whole.</p>

            <div class="section">
              <h4>II. GENERAL RULES AND PRINCIPLES</h4>

              <p class="tei_p">5. a. The band may be formed and maneuvered in <span class="underline">close order</span>, 4-inch interval between files; in <span class="underline">open formation</span>, 9-inch interval between files; and in <span class="underline">playing</span> formation, 60–inch interval between files, unless otherwise prescribed. (TR 130-10)</p>

              <p class="tei_p">b. The distance between ranks in <span class="underline">close order</span> is 40 inches; in <span class="underline">open</span> and <span class="underline">playing formations</span>, 60 inches.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">c. Nebraska R.O.T.C. will seldom use <span class="underline">close order</span>.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">6. DEFINITIONS. These terms are used in describing movements in the manual:
                Alignment: Straight line upon which several individuals or elements</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Cadence: The rate or number of steps per minute of marching. The rate is established at 128 steps per minute, which is known as quick time.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Distance: Space between elements in the direction of depth. Distance is measured from the back of the man in front to the breast of the man in the rear; distance between bandsmen in formation is two paces (60 inches).</p>

                <p class="tei_p">File: Bandsmen arranged in depth. An unoccupied position in a formation is termed a <span class="underline">blank file</span>. Thus a file consists of all men having the same number in each rank (A1, B1, C1, and so on, as in figure 2, below), who are arranged one behind the other.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Formation: Arrangement of bandsmen in their assigned positions.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Interval: Space between elements or men on the same line. The normal interval between bandsman is two paces (60 inches).</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Key-number: When movements are executed in which individuals or groups of men are the units of drill, each man is identified by a distinct letter-number combination corresponding to the alphabetical designation of his rank and the numerical designation of his file in original position in band formation, hereafter called his key-number. It is presented here to facilitate explanation of the text. (See figure 2.)</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Rank: Formation in which men are alongside or abreast of each other.</p>

                <h4>III. COMMANDS.</h4>

               <span class="underline">command</span>, which indicates the movement, such as <span class="underline">Forward</span>; and the <span class="underline">command of execution</span>, such as <span class="underline">MARCH</span>, which starts the execution. There should be a distinct interval between the two parts of commands. It is very important that a drum major time his signals to the fraction of a second, because the band will become accustomed to one way of executing a movement very readily, but will be slow to master a variety of different ways. All movements begin at the command of execution.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">8. In this manual preparatory commands are in <span class="underline">Capitals and Lowercase, Underlined</span>; commands of execution are in <span class="underline">CAPITALS, UNDERLINED</span>. Although a baton signal, accompanied by one or more whistle blasts, will replace most of the verbal commands, it is well, nevertheless, to understand the latter for several reasons. One reason is that all baton signals merely replace verbal commands. Another is that there are situations when verbal commands will be used even although the drum major has his baton and is commanding. The commands covered in section IV have no corresponding baton signals. Most of the commands covered in section V have corresponding baton signals, which are explained and illustrated in section VI.</p>

                <h4>IV. INSTRUCTION OF THE BANDSMAN, WITHOUT INSTRUMENT</h4>

                <p class="tei_p">9. Position of Soldier at Attention. Heels on a line, as close together as possible. Feet turned out equally at an angle of 45°. Knees straight without stiffness. Hips level and drawn back slightly. Body erect and resting equally on hips. Chest lifted and arched. Shoulders square and falling equally. Arms hanging straight back down without stiffness. Thumbs along seams of trousers. Backs of hands out. Fingers are curled naturally. Head erect and square to front. Chin drawn in so the axis of neck and head is vertical. Eyes straight to front. Weight of body resting equally on heels in both feet. The heels are brought together smartly and audibly. The <span class="underline">mind</span> as well as the <span class="underline">body</span> must be out of tension. (When instruments are carried, maintain this position except as modified by the carrying of the instrument.)</p>

                <p class="tei_p">10. The Rests. Being at a halt, the commands are: <span class="underline">FALL OUT</span>; <span class="underline">AT EASE</span>; 1. <span class="underline">Stand at</span>, 2. <span class="underline">EASE</span>; or 1. <span class="underline">Parade</span>, 2. <span class="underline">REST</span>.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">11. At <span class="underline">FALL OUT</span>, the men may leave ranks, but must remain in the vicinity. They resume their positions at <span class="underline">Attention</span> at the command <span class="underline">FALL IN</span>.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">12. At <span class="underline">REST</span>, each man keeps his right foot in place, but is not required to preserve silence or immobility. He may talk, move, etc.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">13. <span class="underline">AT EASE</span> is the same as rest, except that silence is preserved. At 1. <span class="underline">Stand at</span>, 2. <span class="underline">EASE</span>, at the command of execution, move the left foot smartly 12 inches to the left of the right foot, and at the same time clasp hands behind the back, palms to the rear, thumb and fingers of the right hand clasp in the left thumb. Preserve silence and immobility. (Never used in band formation.)</p>

                <p class="tei_p">14. At 1. <span class="underline">Parade</span>, 2. <span class="underline">REST</span>, carry the right foot 6 inches straight to the rear and bend left knee slightly, weight of body resting equally on both feet. At the same time, clasp hands in front of center of body, left hand outermost, fingers straight, left thumb clasped by right hand. Preserve silence and immobility. (There is no occasion when the band executed this movement as a unit. However, it is well to understand this movement as it will be commanded in a review, parade, etc., immediately before the command <span class="underline">SOUND OFF</span>.)</p>

                <p class="tei_p">15. Being in any position of rest, at the command: 1. <span class="underline">Band</span>, 2. <span class="underline">ATTENTION</span>, snap smartly to Attention at the command of execution.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">16. Movements or facings that are executed similarly toward both flanks are explained in this manual as for one flank. To adapt the movement to the other flank, substitute <span class="underline">Left</span> or <span class="underline">Right</span> as required. Such movements are indicated by the word left or right in parentheses in the command.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">17. Facings. All facings are executed in the cadence of quick time. To face to the flank the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Right</span> (<span class="underline">Left</span>), 2. <span class="underline">FACE</span>. At the command FACE, raise slightly the left heel and right toe and turn 90° to the right on the right heel, assisted by pressure of the ball of the left foot. (TWO) Place the left foot smartly beside the right. Left Face is similarly executed on the left heel. No part of the body should move except the left (right) leg. 1. <span class="underline">Right (Left) half</span>, 2. <span class="underline">FACE</span>, is executed similarly, turning 45° instead of 90°.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">To face to the rear the command is: 1. <span class="underline">About</span>, 2. <span class="underline">FACE</span>. Carry the toe of the right foot about a half foot-length to the rear and 3 inches to the left of the left heel, weight of body being chiefly on the left heel, right leg straight. 2. Face to the rear, turning to the right on the left heel and ball of right foot, place the right heel beside the left. Practice this out of rank until you learn exactly where to place your right toe.</p>

                <h4>V. STEPS AND MARCHINGS.</h4>

                <p class="tei_p">18. All steps in marching executed from a halt (except <span class="underline">Right step</span>) begin with the left foot. In quick time the length of a full step (heel to heel) is 30 inches and the cadence is 128 steps per minute. Double time is rarely used in band.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">19. For movements executed towards the right (left), while in march, the command of execution is given as the right (left) foot strikes the ground. Advance and plant the other foot – that is, take one full step – and then execute the movement.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">20. Any movement may be executed either from a halt or while marching, unless otherwise prescribed.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Of direction is 45° instead of 90°. Slight changes are executed at the command: <span class="underline">INCLINE TO THE RIGHT (LEFT)</span>.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">22. Correction of Commands. To arrest a movement for any purpose, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">In Place</span>, 2. <span class="underline">HALT</span>, All halt. To resume the movement, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Resume</span>, 2. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. To retract a preparatory command for any reason, the command is: <span class="underline">AS YOU WERE</span>. The movement is not executed unless both preparatory in command of execution are given anew.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">23. To March Forward: Being at a halt, half step, or marking time, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Forward</span>, 2. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. If at a halt, at the preparatory command, shift the weight to the right foot without perceptible movement. At the command march, take a full step (30 inches) forward with the left foot. Continue to march, allowing the arms to swing naturally, but not excessively (9 inches in all – six ahead, three behind).</p>

                <p class="tei_p">24. To Halt. Being in march or marking time, command is: 1. <span class="underline">Band</span>, 2. <span class="underline">HALT</span>. At the command <span class="underline">HALT</span>, usually given as the left foot strikes the ground for band, but properly given as either foot strikes the ground, advance and point the other foot – that is, take one more full step – then bring the rear foot up and plant it on the line with the other. In marking time or marching backwards, the procedure is similar. That is, take one more step in cadence and then halt.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">25. Half Step. The command is: 1. <span class="underline">Half step</span>, 2. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. Half step is executed exactly the same manner as full step, except that the length of the step is 15 inches. To resume full step, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Forward</span>, 2. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">26. Side Step. Being at a halt or marking time, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Right (Left) Step</span>, 2. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. At the command <span class="underline">MARCH</span>, move and plant the right (left) foot ten inches to the right (left), and bring the other foot alongside. Continue in the cadence of quick time. In halting from side step, the command <span class="underline">HALT</span> should be given as the feet come together. Then take one step to the side and complete the halt as the feet again come together.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">27. Back Step. Being at a halt or marking time, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Backward</span>, 2. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. Backward march is executed in exactly the same manner as forward march, except the length of step is 15 inches and the direction is opposite. The halt is made in the same way. The movement is used for short distances only.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">28. Being at a halt, to face to the right (left) in marching and advance: At the command of execution, turn in the designated direction on the ball of the <span class="underline">right</span> foot and at the same time step off in the new direction with the left foot, taking a full 30-inch step.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">the right (left) in marching, takes one full step to clear the way for the pivot man of the rank just in the rear, and then marches in the new direction at half step. All other men execute smart, precise right oblique until they are on the line with the original pivot file; they then execute the second right oblique, march up abreast of the pivot man and take up the half step. All succeeding ranks execute the movement on the same ground and in the same manner. Resume full step at the command Forward March.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">Turning movements are the most difficult of band drill in which to secure precision and smartness of execution. There is a tendency for the turning point to wander from where it was first established by the leading rank. It is common for those marching at half step to take a step longer than 15 inches. Too short a step is almost as bad. Familiarity with the facings in marching (paragraphs 28 and 29), the oblique march (paragraph 35), and the half step (paragraph 25) are central to the execution of this movement.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">32. The Modified "Wheel" Turn (see figure 4). The command is the same as for the regulation style. At the command of execution, the front rank describes an arc of 90° to the right (left), with the pivot moving immediately in the new direction at a quarter step, and the left- (right-) flank man marching at a full step. Guide is in both directions during the arc, with the interval taken from the moving pivot, which causes the arc to deflect slightly to the right (left).</p>

                <p class="tei_p">When the entire rank is turned in the new direction, it proceeds at a half step. The remainder of the band takes up the half step at the command of execution. All succeeding ranks execute the movement on the same ground and in the same manner. The pivot men will retain the regular distance from the rank in front until they have turned in the new direction, when they will immediately decrease it to half the regular distance; the correct distance will be regained as each rank completes the term. When the entire band is turned, it moves forward at a full step at the drum majors command.</p>

The files to the right of the middle of the band (including the center file) turn to the right about; the files to the left of the middle turn left about; each man marching on the circumference of a circle 30 inches in diameter. Each rank executes the same movement successively, and on the same ground. A separation will be caused in the middle of the band, which will be adjusted by an oblique to the center of each rank as it emerges from the rear of the band, the last rank closing in as soon as the turn is completed. The half step is continued until Forward March is commanded by the drum major as the last rank completes the turn. The movement can be executed at full step; but it is not advisable to do so because of the interference in passing between files, especially since this movement is always executed while playing.</p>

The movement is executed in a manner similar to Increase Front, the files obliquing a like number of steps towards the middle of the band, instead of away from the middle.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">40. CAUTION. In the movements described above, the command of execution must be given at exactly the right time, as a particular foot strikes the ground in most cases. If this command is given between steps, or on the wrong foot, a ragged execution of the movement must result. Practice all of these movements out of ranks until you were able to execute each movement perfectly in any position in the band. Good drill is impossible unless every man correctly executes the fundamental movements.</p>

Regulations require the instruments be carried at the prescribed <span class="underline">carry</span> positions. In R.O.T.C. band, this is not to be insisted upon. In neither of the Route Marches are the men required to keep step, but if marching At Ease, silence must be maintained. If halted while at Route Step, the band is At Rest; if halted while marching At Ease, the band is At Ease. To reestablish cadence, bringing the band to Attention, the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Band</span>, 2. <span class="underline">ATTENTION</span>. Drums commence to beat on the next count.

The drum major is in charge of the band while in formation, commanding it and directing its playing by means of verbal commands and signals of the drum major's baton, in the manipulation of which he must be an expert. For the R.O.T.C. bands, drum majors will be selected on the basis of skills with the baton, force of command, stature, and appearance.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">43. The band captain and his lieutenants assist the instructor in charge to maintain discipline and instruct the band. These duties attach to the officers whether in rehearsal or a drill. In addition, the officers will be in charge of social functions and the promotion of other activities of the band.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">44. When in formation, the drum major and field officers only salute for the entire band when saluting is prescribed in AR 600-25. The drum major and officers will be held to a knowledge of the applicable regulations, which they will apply by hand or baton salute.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">a. <span class="underline">Order baton</span> is the habitual position of the baton when the band is at a halt in playing formation and not playing. The baton is held at an angle of 60° with the horizontal, ferrule on ground on a line with and touching toe of right shoe, ball up and to right, right hand grasping staff near ball, back of hand to front, left hand on hip, fingers in front and joined, thumb to rear.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">47. Baton signals include the same two parts as verbal commands (section II, paragraph 7), namely: a preparatory command and command of execution. The positions of the baton, set out in the following paragraphs, supersede the words spoken. A whistle is used along with the baton for training purposes, one blast for each part of the command, but is not necessary for most signals.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">48. To start to play the command is: 1. <span class="underline">Ready Instruments</span> (inset d), 2. <span class="underline">Prepare to Play</span> (insert e), 3. <span class="underline">PLAY</span>. At the first signal, which is analogous to the tapping on the stand in concert, place fingers in proper places, etc. At the second signal, bring instruments into playing position, tighten the muscles of the lips to secure the proper embouchure and be ready for the command of execution, <span class="underline">PLAY</span>. The signal for the final command is always without a whistle blast, which may be a part of the first two signals. The baton positions are as follows: 1. The arm is extended to its full length horizontally, ferrule up and vertical. 2. The baton is held extended to the right at an angle of 45°, arm and ferrule forming a continuous straight line. 3. Baton is brought to <span class="underline">Port baton</span> (inset c). Drum major should count this command to himself: Ready, 2, 3, 4, Prepare to Play, 2, 3, PLAY. The first note of the march will sound on count one after the signal for the command of execution. The drum major may face the band in giving this signal.</p>

When the last battalion has executed the command, the band plays the National Anthem. FIVE. Adjutant orders: 1. <span class="underline">Order</span>, 2. <span class="underline">ARMS</span>. This is executed at the command of battalion commanders. When the adjutant commands: 1. <span class="underline">Officers</span>, 2. <span class="underline">CENTER</span>, 3. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>, the band starts to play at drum major's signal when the command <span class="underline">MARCH</span>, is given, and continues to play until the last officer has returned to his place in his battalion. However, when the officers are halted six paces in front of the reviewing officer, the volume of playing is diminished considerably, and increased again as soon as the command <span class="underline">MARCH</span>, is given in: 1. <span class="underline">Officers</span>, 2. <span class="underline">POSTS</span>, 3. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. SIX. The adjutant then command: <span class="underline">PASS IN REVIEW</span>. The band moves forward or out of position, its full length without drums, and halts at the drum major's command. As the first battalion commander orders: 1. <span class="underline">Leading Platoon</span>, 2. <span class="underline">Right by Squads</span>, or other command, drum major gives the signal for: 1. <span class="underline">Ready Instruments</span>, 2. <span class="underline">Prepare to Play</span>. When the battalion commander gives the command: 3. <span class="underline">MARCH</span>, the band steps off on the next count, drum major giving the signal for: 3. <span class="underline">PLAY</span>, when he hears the command <span class="underline">MARCH</span>. As the band passes the reviewing stand, drum major salutes. The band is then brought around to face the reviewing stand by three successive Column Left movements, and continues to play when halted until the last unit has completely passed the reviewing stand. The drum major must salute the colors when they pass.</p>

                <p class="tei_p">62. For inspection, the band will follow the regulations in Section VI of TR 130-10 governing <span class="underline">Inspection Instrument</span> positions.</p>

              <h3>PART II. THE FOOTBALL BAND</h3>

              <p class="tei_p">At non-military occasions where the band is called upon to perform, the movements described in Part I may be departed from at the discretion of the drill instructor. More latitude can be taken by the band acting as a separate unit than when it accompanies troops. Often special formations do not involve the entire band or even an entire rank or file. For a band well drilled in fundamentals, an infinite variety of formations may be worked out.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">One very practical variation of a movement described in Part I is the "block" turn. This is a style of turning in which the bandsmen move individually in such a way that the original front rank becomes a flank and the movement is completed on the ground in which it was once commenced. The employment of this movement makes it possible to gauge more accurately the space necessary to change the direction of march on a football field.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">Figure 9 more clearly explains this movement than verbal description. It is executed as follows: Employing the same number of ranks nearest the front of the band as the number of files, thus forming telescoped squares, men in  each square walk one-fourth of the way around the outline, executing the necessary facings automatically. The remaining ranks face in the direction opposite the way in which the band is turning. As a unit, those ranks execute a military order to stay back of the square of the band.</p>

              <div class="inline_figure">
            <div class="p">[figure]</div>
                <span class="tei_label">Figure 9. "Block Left Turn."</span>
              </div>

              <p class="tei_p">This movement may be imitated in "block" countermarch, marching half-way around the squares, instead of a quarter of the way. In this instance the square of the band may be taken from ranks nearest the center. The remaining men may be split into four groups, so that one half of the ranks ahead of the square go to the rear around the right side and the other half around the left side; one half of the ranks</p>

              <p class="tei_p">to the rear of the square go to the front around either side. The direction in which the squares march may be alternated so that each square goes in the opposite direction to the one on either side of it. This is illustrated in figure 10.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">THE "6 X 16" FORMATION, executed in the manner here described, was used first by University of Nebraska bands as a starting formation for spelling words of several letters where it is desirable to begin with a long, narrow column. It is used by a 96-piece band of eight files and twelve ranks to form six files and sixteen ranks. At a signal, the last six ranks halt at the same time that the front six start to execute an irreversible countermarch (paragraph 34), said front ranks coming to a halt in the intervals in the last six ranks. The completed movement is illustrated in figure 11. The men represented by shaded circles are facing the reader and are the part of the band which has executed the countermarch. The men represented by clear circles are facing away from the reader and are the part which remained stationary.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">The movements which are executed from the "6 X 16" formation are customarily explained on instruction cards. It can be stated generally that this formation is executed in the exact center of the football field. A portion of the men in the formation face one goal line and another portion face the opposite goal line. Some of the center may remain in place. Groups of men forming various letters take a given number of steps. When thus in place, a signal is given for the entire word to be formed simultaneously.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">There are, of course, many other ways of maneuvering into various lineups which may be used, but "6 X 16" formation, executed as above described, will be a standard starting position. It has the advantage of accuracy unaffected by the playing of the band, because half of the ranks remain stationary and serve as guides for the others to form on. Also, there is a unique affect in the apparent confusion of the irreversible countermarch clearing as the movement is completed.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">PROGRAMS AT FOOTBALL GAMES are designed and mimeographed on several sheets, which are individually marked with colored pencils so that movements required may be ascertained at a glance, and are mounted on cards which are distributed to the band at drills and before football games. Complete information of all that is to be played or done is contained on the various sheets. Instruction cards are carried on the lyre of the instrument. Presented below is the material attached to instruction cards used by Nebraska bands at the Nebraska-Pittsburgh game at Lincoln on November 14, 1936.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">The first sheet on the instruction card is the "Game Plan". This is a synopsis of all formations, music and signals in their proper order. This appears here as figure 12, page 21.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">A varsity band of 96 pieces and a junior band of 48 pieces were used. The latter remained at one end of the field until the finale, in which it was used. As a "curtain-riser", the varsity band formed in a close formation back of a "V" or wedge of trumpets. Following playing a trumpet fanfare, the band marched silently for eight steps, playing march <span class="underline">Gloria</span> on the ninth. The trumpets filed into their proper placed in ranks as the band marched past.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">Continuing to play, the band marched west across the 50-yard line until the drum major commanded Mark Time as the front rank reached the 40-yard line. At this point, the drill instructor on the sidelines opposite the band fired two blank cartridge shots four counts apart. The second shot was a command of execution for a "block" left turn, described and illustrated on page 17, figure 9.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">At the completion of this maneuver, the band marked time facing east. The next formation was "PITT", spelled by the varsity band in large double-line letters animated by marching to music around the outline of the letters. The information necessary for this formation has been condensed into one sheet and appears here as figure 13, page 22. It is self-explanatory.</p>

            </a>
         </span>

              <p class="tei_p">These instructions having been carried out, the band returned to band formation. Then maneuvered into "6 X 16" (page 18). Then the band formed "HUSKERS" following instructions on page 23, figure 14. The band commenced playing <span class="underline">There Is No Place Like Nebraska</span>, then returned to "6 X 16". This is number 6 on the game plan.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">Number 7 on the game plan gives the first instructions applicable to the Junior band. Still playing "No Place", the Varsity band completed the countermarch half-executed when it first formed "6 X 16</p>

              <p class="tei_p">Number 7 on the game plan gets the first instructions applicable to the Junior band. Still playing "No Place", the Varsity band completed the countermarch half-executed when it first formed "6 X 16", this time to get back into band formation. Now headed west, three military right turns (paragraph 31, page 7) are executed bringing the front rank to the 45-yard line, the band headed south, playing having been stopped in the course of maneuvering. The Junior band, designated by number-letter symbols to distinguish it from the Varsity band's key-numbers, moved out to the west edge of the field, stopped on the 47-yard line, arriving at its position at the same time as the Varsity.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">The finale formation was a huge shield emblem with clusters of men for stars and lines of men for stripes, covering two-thirds of the width of the field. Its effectiveness depended not only upon placing of the men, but also upon the utilization of contrastingly colored uniforms, so that the outline of the shield was the red and white of the Varsity band and the stars and stripes were of the powder blue of the Junior band. The colorful formation was the setting for Sousa's <span class="underline">Stars and Stripes Forever</span>.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">To aid both bands in getting into position for this formation, the white yard lines were designated as guides. Both bands, and simultaneous signals from their respective drum majors, executed "block" right turns, stepping off on the first note of "Stars and Stripes". Junior band marked time facing east while the outside files at Varsity band and obliqued to the 40-yard line nearest each file and traced the shell of the shield into the Junior band. As soon as one file head cleared it, the next remaining file followed by the same procedure. Varsity drum major moved up to the top center point of the shield. When the shell has been almost completed, the Junior drum major move his band out, the men stopping in their proper places, Junior drum major forming the opposite point. Both drum majors beat time facing toward each other at opposite points of the shield.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">Such a program as that just described is more complicated than necessary to provide an entertaining future at football games. A simpler program with less difficult formations is not only easier to design in the first place, but also requires less practice to master it and involves less chance for error. There is a practical limit to what can be done by a band. If a word has more than four or five letters, it will be thin when spelled by the band, and hence less legible than a word of six or seven letters. The "HUSKERS" formation might be criticized on that ground, although photographs made of the Pittsburgh game program show that this formation was legible.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">A single letter, such as the letter "N" shown in figure 16, is an effective formation. This particular one is formed from the two halves of the band split by obliquing from the center a distance of eight steps to the right or left oblique. The band marks time until a signal is given, at which it moves into the positions indicated by encircled key-numbers. The drum major gives further commands. Spelling words by a series of similar letters, one at a time, as the band moves the length or diagonally across the field, is practical.</p>

              <p class="tei_p">The CANNON formation, shown on page 27, figure 18, was a successful employment of a well-known march, Sousa's <span class="underline">U. S. Field Artillery</span>, as a theme around which to build a formation. The spokes of the wheel were formed first by the men in the first three ranks around the drum major standing on the 50-yard line. Then, Right and Left by File was executed by the remaining men, who followed the contour of the wheel and muzzle. Finally, the trail was formed by all not otherwise used. When in formation, at the drum major's command, the band played <span class="underline">U. S. Field Artillery</span>. The wheel revolved around the hub. At the trio, the men sang the words shown on figure 18 without accompaniment. At the</p>

              <p class="tei_p">Another practical means of spelling words is to have the letters peel off the band from the front or flank, one letter at a time, and move the length of the field or diagonally across it, to reform in band formation after the word has been completely spelled out, each letter breaking up as it reaches the band. Figure 17 illustrates this method with the word "TIGERS" used at the Nebraska-Missouri game at Lincoln, October 31, 1936. Arrows show direction of march.</p>
