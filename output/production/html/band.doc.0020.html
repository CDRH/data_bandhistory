The Chancellor,
<br/>University of Nebraska.
<br/>My dear Chancellor Burnett:
</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Relative to the matter of the appointment of a committee to raise funds by which the band may make certain trips with the football team I believe it advisable to have this committee composed of those who are familiar with raising funds for University objects. I would, therefore, suggest the following for such a committee:</p>

      <ul class="tei_list_rend_simple tei_list">
         <li>Mr. John K. Selleck</li>
         <li>Mr. Harold F. Holts</li>
         <li>The P. M. S. &amp; T.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="tei_p">It is believed that this committee could map out some permanent method of raising funds and determine what trips the band should make. It is believed that it is not necessary for the band to make a long trip each year but the committee could function so that the funds would be available at the time a long trip is to be made. This would save a strenuous campaign for funds at the particular time the trip is planned.</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Very sincerely yours,</span>
         <span class="tei_signed">
F. F. Jewett,
<br/>Lieut. Col., Inf., (DOL)
<br/>P.M.S.&amp;T.
