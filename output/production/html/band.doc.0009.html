            <br/>Dear Jack:
</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">The opportunity you gave me in 1961, as UNL Cornhuskers first solo twirler, has allotted me a lifetime of treasured memories to fill my heart forever.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">In one moment, I burst out of Big Bertha's innermost depths, into a world of band sounds and cheering crowds. Because you dared to break tradition, the door was opened for many young ladies to continue their talents in music, flag corp and baton twirling while at UNL. Countless thousands of Nebraskan's have enjoyed the Cornhusker Marching Band and will continue to do for many years to come.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">May you know now that I have and will always honor and respect you for the kind and caring gentleman you are.</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Your First "Golden Girl"</span>
         <span class="tei_signed">
