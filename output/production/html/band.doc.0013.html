            <br/>Lieut Dudley,
<br/>Dear Sir;</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">I feel that my salary for teaching the Cadet Band is decidedly too little and should be raised for the coming year if my services are desired. It is now $50.00 per term, making it $150.00 per year. I have taught many bands , and I have never taught any band aside from the University leader Band for less than $2.50 per lesson, and from that to $4.50 per lesson I have given the band from about 24 to 45 lessons per term. 24 for the winter term and about 45 for each of both the fall and spring terms. At the lower figure, $2.50 per lesson would amount to about $286.00. At the very least I think it should be raised to $250.00.</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">
         <span class="tei_salute">Yours Respectfully,</span>
