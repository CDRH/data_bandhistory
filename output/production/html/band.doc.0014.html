<br/>Dear Sir
</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">May I ask you to consider the great need of the Cadet Band for instruments.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">None have been purchased for their use for many years, save two which I secured two years ago from receipts for services rendered by the Band during a political campaign.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">The price of horns most needed and absolutely necessary for effective playing will cost $220.00.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">There are six or seven old instruments entirely useless which may be exchanged for part payment of new ones, and they might possibly bring one half of the cost of new ones. I would, therefore, ask for authority to make such exchange and earnestly request that the band allow the difference in cash.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I wish to add that the organization has never before contained so much talent nor has it ever had so efficient and pain-staking a leader.
</p>
