Chancellor E. A. Burnett,
<br/>The University of Nebraska
<br/>Lincoln.
<br/>Dear Chancellor Burnett:
</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Mr. Kirkpatrick asked me to write you relative to the amount of work I was to continue on with the Senior band. It was my understanding that Mr. Lentz would take over all the work of the Senior band. Since Mr. Lentz will not be expected to take care of the Military or Athlete departments work, may I suggest getting a marching instructor who will assist in taking care of the Athlete department work I am willing to help him. I will take the work of the Military department besides taking care of the Freshman band and assist Mr. Lentz in any way I can, and continue on with my small orchestra and Agricultural College work.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">We talked of a 1200 salary for myself but I am willing it be 1000. per year in order to get a marching instructor who can take care of the Athlete work.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I know Col. Oury Would like to have a band marching instructor for the spring review work. We have talked of Mr. Lyle Welch and feel he would fit in and be a great help to us in making the band a good marching organization.. I suggest paying Mr. Welch [blacked out]. per year. With Mr. Lentz taking care of the concert work it will give the band a fine staff for the band is getting larger each year.</p>

      <p class="tei_p">I am quite certain this arrangement would be satisfactory to both Mr. Kirkpatrick and Col. Oury,</p>

      <span class="tei_closer">

Sincerely Yours,
<br/>W. T. Quick
