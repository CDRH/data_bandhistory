<br/>My dear Colonel Jewett:</span>
      </span>

      <p class="tei_p">Replying to your favor of the 27th ult., in line with our conversation, I think the uniforms for the band should be maintained in good condition so that they make a good appearance. If it has been customary for the University to furnish such uniforms, I should say that this would be a legitimate item in your budget when making out the request for next year.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I think everyone recognizes that the band is a University institution and that the numbers need to present a good appearance. We cannot, of course, charge this up against them personally.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">In the matter of a committee to raise funds by which the band may make trips with the football team or to represent the University, if upon consideration you think it advisable to appoint such a committee I should be glad to have you make recommendations as to the personnel of the committee.</p>
      <p class="tei_p">I am</p>
