<salute>MEMO TO THE CHANCELLOR</salute>
</opener>

<p>It is recommended that the University go on a commutation basis for uniforms for the basic students. This will provide a much better looking uniform than the one now worn. The design of the uniform to be decided by the University authorities.</p>

<p>The procedure for obtaining the commutation is a request to the Government for commutation in each instead of the issue uniforms now worn. The effect of such a change would be as follows:</p>

<p>Judging from the past 2 years, there would be initially about 2000 uniforms to be provided. This excludes the advanced students and 81 members of the Band, who are already under commutation.</p>

<p>An excellent uniform can be obtained for $25 per uniform; better quality than the presentations. The 2000 uniforms would have to be secured at the initiation of this change. This would require, at the price indicated, $50,000. This $50,000 can be met in this way: The Government would pay $20,000 or $10 per student the 1st year. The student himself is required to deposit $10 when he draws his uniform.</p>

<p>This as now would secure about $40,000 the 1st year; $20,000 by the Government and $20,000 by the student deposits.</p>

<p>The 2nd year the Government again furnishes $20,000 or $10 per man which, with the $10 deposited by the students relieves the University of my indebitness whatsoever for that year. The 3rd year there would again be $20,000 from the Government. During the 3rd year there would be some upkeep, but not a vast amount. This would put the University decidedly ahead financially. Our experience with the issue uniforms, is that they last about 6 years. A few uniforms and parts of uniforms are torn and condemned each year, but this amounts to comparatively little. Judging from this at the end of the 3rd year, the commutation would be decidedly in favor of the University. While the 4th, 5th, and 6th year there would be a greater upkeep by replacement and repair, a very considerable amount of the commutation would be available to the University. It is understood that this amount is used for uniforms in various ways.</p>

<pb facs="band.doc.0023.002"/>

<p>Some of our neighboring universities are on commutation basis now. Iowa and Minnesota are good examples. In each case the student is better equipped then [than] here and in each case they have funds for building morale, etc., not available to us. I believe it would be a very decided improvement in the military regime, if the University authorities could find a way of asking for this commutation.</p>
