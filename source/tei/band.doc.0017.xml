<lb/>Re: Lieut. Charles Ledwith
<lb/>Gentlemen:
</salute>
</opener>

<p>A few days ago Mr. Ledwith informed me that he is having difficulty in obtaining any compensation for the work he has done for bands of the University during the past three semesters and he expressed his opinion that a letter from me might cause this claim to be honered [honored].</p>

<p>Throughout the period during which Mr. Ledwith rendered his services to the bands he told me of the steps he had taken to secure proper authorization for the work. I am sure he reasonably believed that the work was properly authorized, and that any failure to fulfill technical requirements was due to no fault of his own. He told me of the conversations he had had with Mr Gunderson and with Dean Thompson, and he told me of the several occasions when he inquired if it would be necessary to confer with the Chancellor and was told that it would not be. I had frequent reports on his work from Mr. Quick, who always reported very favorably. Mr. Quick also told me of having seen Mr. Gunderson in regard to this matter.</p>

<p>Most of the work that was done by Mr. Ledwith had never been attempted before by anyone at the University. His first move in the spring of 1936 was to write and produce from mimeographed stencils, which he cut, a 17 page manual for the band. This has been adopted as the text for both bands. He also drilled the band commencing in the spring of 1936. During the summer of that year he designed formations which were executed by the band at the football games. Each man in the band was furnished with mimeographed instructions for each formation, individually marked so that he would know what to do in the formation. This material stimulated the band in its work more than anything else ever had. Ledwith was in sole</p>

<p>charge of the newly-organized freshman band, which was long needed to remove from the other band inexperienced players. He served as musical director as well as drilling instructor.</p>

<p>I might also mention that during Mr. Quick's illness in December and January of last winter, the sole responsibility of directing both band was borne by Ledwith for about one month. He also took charge of the band at football rallies, the Farmers Fair horse show and most of the basketball games.</p>

<p>Mr. Ledwith's work not only improved the band, noticably in marching and in morale but in addition he devoted much time to preparing and revising the manual for the band which has been and will be extremely useful in the future. I have felt all along that the young man should receive some comopensation for his time if there is a fund from which it can be paid. I am sure that such payment would be only fair, taking into account the results of his work.</p>
